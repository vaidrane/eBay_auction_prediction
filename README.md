# eBay_auction_prediction
This is academic projects based on prediction of eBay auction's competitiveness.

Problem Statement:
Instead of strict prices and amounts that dictate the consumer attitude toward purchasing, the procedure of buying and selling to a self-imposed price brings about an entirely new way to understand the rationality behind internet sales and auctions on sites like eBay.
In order for the seller to earn the most profit, he has to consider manay factors that might influence the auction closing prices and can earn him a good profit. There are days when competition is more, and the length of days the auction is released for also impressively impacts the competition.
